<u><b><h1 align="center">hello students</h1></b></u>
<p>Good Morning ,Coming back after a break is never easy. 
After a fun-filled vacation, students may feel a little lazy. <br>
They might not be excited to submit to a daily schedule again, signifying a new academic year. <br>
When students return to school or college to attend a new year or semester<br></p>
<h2>THANK YOU</h2>
